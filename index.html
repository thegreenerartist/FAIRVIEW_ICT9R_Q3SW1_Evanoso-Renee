	<font color="#540000"><h4>Photographer Adam Faulkner-Stanheight and Doctor Lawrence Gordon wake up chained to pipes on opposite sides of a dirty, decrepit bathroom with no recollection of how they got there. In the middle of the room is a dead man holding a record player and a gun. They are given various clues in order to help them escape, which leads them to a bag that contains two hacksaws - too dull to cut through metal, but sharp enough to cut through flesh and bone...  </h4>

		<font color="#d90000"><h2>Comments...</h2></font>
		<font color="#540000"><ul>
			<li>A very well produced film despite the budget limitations. The production team uses their small, run-down sets to their advantage, making the traps feel claustrophobic and dirty. The trademark green lighting further amplifies the 'sickliness' of the traps and the general cool, artificial lights give an unsettling feeling all throughout. </li>
			<li>The Jigsaw Killer's motivations are certainly unique; a murderer that doesn't murder for revenge, nor for recognition, but for rehabilitation. It doesn't mean he's consistent with that ideology but that IS what he believes his ideology is.</li>
			<li>The beautiful wordplay in all the clues left by Jigsaw is amazing, the "OH!" moment when you finally realize the true meaning of seemingly convuluted clues... It's elite.</li>
			<li>Don't let your wife prevent you from finding your soulmate (Re; Lawrence and Adam)(/joking)</li>
			<li>Adam's scream and John's "Game Over" at the end of the movie ill forever be one of the most iconic movie sequences I've ever heard.
			<li>Please watch it, whoever may read this. I am desperate to talk about it to someone.</li>
